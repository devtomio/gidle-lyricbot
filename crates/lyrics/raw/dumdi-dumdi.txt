With the hot sun I’m a little crazy
My cheeks are easily flushed
And then I feel dizzy and flushed
Like swimming I start dancing
I want to play the music louder
So that people can’t hear our love
Even if we’re hugging I want to be closer to you
For our touching hearts to explode

The wind makes my heart beat
The waves make my heart pound
Like the drummer over there
Knock on my heart
Play me the song of this summer
(Turn up the summer)

Every night every mind
Every time every sign
Wherever I go here’s tropical night
On a steamy day a biting wind over the sweltering night sea
Unforgettably burning night

Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi
Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi
Turn up my summer
Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi
Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi
Turn up my summer

Hey drummer volume up with the heat wave
Kick & snare melts our wall
Oh god drenched underwear
Dance until the palm trees shake
In the festival with fireworks I clear my head
Like crazy music turnt up
Splashing waves’ Beat is Dugu dung dugu dung
DJ wind is ppikkippikkium

I want to give more love more fiercely
So that you can feel my season
Like this I want to close my eyes tightly
Forever even if the sun rises

The wind is breezing
The waves are lapping
Like the dancers over there
Shake my heart
Play me the song of this summer
(Turn up the summer)

Every night every mind
Every time every sign
Wherever I go here’s tropical night
On a steamy day a biting wind over the sweltering night sea
Unforgettably burning night

Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi
Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi
Turn up my summer
Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi
Dumdi dumdi dumdi dumdi

When the moon falls asleep and the summer is cooled down
Sing to me the song of the hot time

Shout it out loud, hey
Let’s turn up my summer bae
Hit the drum

Dumdidumdum dumdididumdum
Dumdidumdum dumdididumdum
Dumdidumdum dumdididumdum
Dumdidumdum
Turn up my summer
Dumdidumdum dumdididumdum
Dumdidumdum
Dumdidumdum dumdididumdum
Dumdidumdum
Turn up my summer
