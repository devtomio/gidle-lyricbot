Do you remember you remember
Remember what you said
You started talking to me
As if you would give anything to me
Don’t you remember you remember
Remember what you said
Then you changed
As if you took special pills
Cast blue, my blurred vision
Is this true? You won’t regret this?
My yesterday, my boo boo boo
Lonely life, I like it
I swallowed the water, I got cold
I want you to be ruined, I won’t hold you
You were my yesterday, my boo boo boo
Lonely life, good bye

You look at me with cold eyes
You see me and turn as if you didn’t know me
I just stand here vacantly
I see you who I didn’t know
I can’t help laughing
Now I don’t know you anymore

I’ll forget you woo woo woo
Go away, don’t even look back
I’ll erase you woo woo woo
Go away, don’t even look back

Do you remember you remember
Remember what you said
I couldn’t say anything
I just let you go
Don’t you remember you remember
Remember what you said
Then I changed
As if I took special pills

Everything changed
Like common love, it was obvious
Like a hungry lion, you wanted me desperately
Your touch, your word
If it was lie, you would be the worst one
That’s how it is
What my mom says is always right
My love turned into black
It just burned black
I erased you from my memory today

You look at me with cold eyes
You see me and turn as if you didn’t know me
I just stand here vacantly
I see you who I didn’t know
I can’t help laughing
Now I don’t know you anymore

I’ll forget you woo woo woo
Go away, don’t even look back
I’ll erase you woo woo woo
Go away, don’t even look back

I erase your trace in my bruised heart
My heart is reflected on your familiar eyes
You’ll be surprised because it’s too cold
Even if you come back,
there is no place for you
It’s done, I don’t know you

I’ll forget you woo woo woo
Go away, don’t even look back
I’ll erase you woo woo woo
Go away, don’t even look back
