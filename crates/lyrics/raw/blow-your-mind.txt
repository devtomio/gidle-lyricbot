Don’t wanna be unsteady
Don’t wanna be uncertain
I just want to stay calm
I’m like your shadow
Every time I see you
Closing my eyes
Every time I need you
Stay in front of me
Baby you
You are already in all of my mind woo
You are the reason why I woo
You make me crazy
I think at some point I got caught in your heart
It feels like I fall even deeper
I love you to death
From your body to your head
To your heart everything will be mine
Don’t stay there, come closer to me
It’s not the same, don’t think of backing out
Think about it, what are the two of us going to do tomorrow?
Baby you
You are already in all of my mind woo
You are the reason why I woo
You make me crazy
I think at some point I got caught in your heart
Blow your mind look here
Don’t leave even at the smallest moment
Baby you
You are already in all of my mind woo
You are the reason why I woo
You make me crazy
I think at some point I got caught in your heart
