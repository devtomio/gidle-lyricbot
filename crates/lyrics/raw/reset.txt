Let’s break up, is that all you can say?
How are you selfish until the end?
Yes, let’s break up, that is better
I was too good for a jerk like you

Meet my friends whom I couldn’t meet
Buy a present for me
I think being alone is better than I thought
Saying that to the mirror

Splashing ocean, the day my life drowned
With my breathing stopped, live day by day
Incoming wind, the day my heart drowned
When can this rough day end
And open again?

Reset my phone, the photo I cherished
The 5 years of time became useless
After all with your friends
That were filled in my message
Still, your empty profile is disgusting

Sometimes drink some alcohol
There’s a lot of guys that like me
I think being alone is better than I thought
Saying that to the mirror

Splashing ocean, the day my life drowned
With my breathing stopped, live day by day
Incoming wind, the day my heart drowned
When can this rough day end
And open again?

I don’t like you anymore as well
This lie that no one will know
Yes, no no
But I’m not stupid
You know I’m always honest

Don’t leave, words I swallowed
I still like you, with my heart
Won’t come back, I should hold myself back
Would I be able
To start a new love like you?
