Ay, yo, you know what, I'm waiting for ya, I only want ya
They say I'm loca, but hey whatever, I only want ya
Running the red light, moving the left right, we goin' all night
I'll take you higher, set it on fire, you're my desire
Uh-oh, what do you got to lose, keep it going baby
Falling down, you and I, we can get caught up in the moment
You like that? Go, go, burn until there's nothing left
'Cause I don't care about tomorrow, no
There ain't nothing I won't do for you, fall with me, Lata
Dance the night away with me, let me sing for you, Lata
Latata latata latata latata latata latata latata latata
Sing for me until you're burnt in my memory, Lata
I love ya
Every day, every night Latata
I love ya
Every day, every night Latata
Don't be lazy, come over baby
I'm only getting started, time is of the essence
I'll open up, you can go a little deeper
Dig it up and you can keep goin' 'til you're dizzy
Tear it up, tear it up, singing latata
They don't know what to say, goin' dot dot dot
Ready or not, we making it hot
The jealousy feels good to me, mwah-mwah-mwah
Uh-oh, how far do you wanna go with me?
Keep on movin' 'til the sunrise and we can get crazy
You like that? Go, go, burn until there's nothing left
'Cause I don't care about tomorrow, no
There ain't nothing I won't do for you, fall with me, Lata
Dance the night away with me, let me sing for you, Lata
Latata latata latata latata latata latata latata latata
Sing for me until you're burnt in my memory, Lata
I love ya
Every day, every night Latata
I love ya
Every day, every night Latata
Ay, yo, you know what, I'm waiting for ya, I only want ya
They say I'm loca, but hey whatever, I only want ya
Running the red light, moving the left right, we goin' all night
I'll take you higher, set it on fire, you're my desire
I love ya
Every day, every night Latata
I love ya
Every day, every night Latata
