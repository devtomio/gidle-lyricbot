A stupid looking face with glasses
Waking up with sleep in my eyes
I eat a lot when I’m hungry lately
Nice I think I’m gonna die
When I lie down
Beside the cool looking you
I don’t believe it
After asking you about love
I sleep comfortably

Here and there, why is everything cool?
No matter who looks at you, you look cool
To me who’s worried every night
To me who likes you

Please give me your love
No matter how much I receive it’s not enough
I like you
I seem to like you this much

Why are you so cool, I’m nervous
Such an undeserving person
Why do I like him? What am I going to do?
You came to me

Sometimes you tell me that you’re tired
When I behave annoyingly
My sad heart grow like stars
It’s irritating

I know that I behaved well
More than badly
I’m sorry, I just keep getting angry
I’m happy when we are together
I love you, let’s always be happy

Here and there, wherever, it won’t happen again
My love is the last one next to you
To me who’s going to be with you forever
To me who’s fallen deep for you

Please give me your love
No matter how much I receive it’s not enough
I like you
I seem to really like you this much

Why are you so cool, I’m nervous
Such an undeserving person
Why do I like him? What am I going to do?
You came to me

I am grateful to you
Who loves me

I’ll give you my love
Nobody can love you more than this
I like you
I seem to really like you this much

Why are you so cool, I’m nervous
Such an undeserving person
Are you listening? It’s you
I like you so much
