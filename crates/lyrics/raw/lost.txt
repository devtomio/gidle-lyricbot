If I cover the blinding sunlight with my hand, will it get dark?
If I cover you from stained memories, will you be forgotten?

Do you maybe remember like me?
The many warm nights pass by
After you left, without me knowing
I was somehow endure it well

I don’t wanna think about you
Without you
We can’t be together like how we used to be
I don’t wanna think about you
Without you
Even when I turn back, you’re not there

I lost everything now
I can’t go back anymore
Now only I forget about you
I erase every single thing

What’s all this love? Just take it all, yes
Just because of you who don’t love me
I don’t want to waste my tears, yes, I’ll take this chance
To film a perfect ending, this is truly the end
I won’t wait, don’t regret it, yeah
I’m the one who hurts now, but you’re the one who lost me
Because I love you

Do you maybe remember like me?
The many warm nights pass by
If you had somehow forcefully erased me
I hope you can share how you did that

I don’t wanna think about you
Without you
We can’t be together like how we used to be
I don’t wanna think about you
Without you
Even when I turn back, you’re not there

Dum ta dum tatatata tara
Dum ta dum tata tararara
Now only I forget about you
I erase every single thing

I don’t wanna think about you
Without you
Now I, I lost you
I don’t wanna think about you
Without you
Now I, I lost you

If I cover the blinding sunlight with my hand, will it get dark?
Our memories in it, will they resurface again?
