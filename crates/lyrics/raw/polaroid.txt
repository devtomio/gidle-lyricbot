Capturing us, the immature, in a photo
I want to keep it so I won't forget it
In my pocket, in my pocket
A lot of people want us to grow up
Time just flies so fast
I want pleasure, want pleasure, mm

Why was everything so difficult back then?
Don't be sad
Let's forget everything with the flash

Can I take out the polaroid
And then we smile brightly
I won't cry even if I get sad
Let's make a funny face
Take out the polaroid
We shouldn't forget this, please remember
In our picturе, that smile at that time
Let's makе a funny face

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I think we can look back
'Cause we've been too busy, we've been too busy
Let's take a break
So that we can be happy and smile more

Why was everything so difficult back then?
Don't be sad
Let's forget everything with the flash

Can I take out the polaroid
And then we smile brightly
I won't cry even if I get sad
Let's make a funny face
Take out the polaroid
We shouldn't forget this, please remember
In our picture, that smile at that time
Let's make a funny face

Ah, ah, ah
Polaroid, we should keep this memory
Ah, ah, ah
Take out the polaroid
Ah, ah, ah
Polaroid, we should keep this memory
Ah, ah, ah

Can I take out the polaroid
And then we smile brightly
I won't cry even if I get sad
Let's make a funny face
Take out the polaroid
We shouldn't forget this, please remember
In our picture, that smile at that time
Let's make a funny face

Ah, ah, ah
Polaroid, we should keep this memory
Ah, ah, ah
Take out the polaroid
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Let's make a funny face
