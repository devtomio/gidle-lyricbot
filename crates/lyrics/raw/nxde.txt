Why you think that ’bout nude
’Cause your view’s so rude
Think outside the box
Then you’ll like it

Hello my name is Yeppi Yeppi
Slightly dumb the way I talk, but I’ve got sexy, sexy figure
Well, for a tiara with a diamond
Did you think I’d just laugh as if, laugh as if

Twisted Lorelei that Don’t need no man
A bookworm obsessed with philosophy, a Self-made woman
Very flabbergasted by this sassy Story
Audience booing and shouting “You tricked me you’re a liar”

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah a night of broken starlight
Even if I look tacky or fall apart
Even if I’m not loved anymore

Yes I’m a nude
Nude Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Yes I’m a nude
Nude (I don’t give a love)

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra

(Ouch!)
Excusez-moi, to all of you who are sitting here
If you were expecting some rated R show
Oh I’m sorry, but that’s not what we’re showing
For Refund, see that direction,
whatever people say is not my interest
You’re welcome to throw those popcorns
Rating is just the inverse of bliss
But my climax, I feel sick
of those prejudice made by themselves

Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah no more shameless night
Even if I look tacky or perhaps to you
Even if I’m not loved anymore

Yes I’m a nude
Nude Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Yes I’m a nude
Nude (I don’t give a love)

Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra

Um ha um ha um ha um
Yes I’m a nude
Yes I’m a nude
Now I draw a luxury nude

Why you think that ’bout nude
’Cause your view’s so rude
Think outside the box
Speak out

My beautiful self
My beautiful self
I’m born nude
You’ve got a dirty mind

Rude
Nude
