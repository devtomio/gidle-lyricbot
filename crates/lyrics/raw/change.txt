Woke up in another new day
Something has changed
Don’t feel the same
Alone hearing voices in my head
Thought that I had it all
But it feels like nobody cares, nobody cares
In a tiffany dress, get off from white van
Walk the red carpet, flash that burst brightly
The interest of the whole world, countless fans
Yes, I received too much love
It’s a life I’ve been dreaming for
And it’s a life where my dreams disappeared
How big of a thing I should gain… to be happy? I wonder tonight
Love and fame
It seems to be enough
When the truth is not that beautiful
Tears and pain
Are things I’ve never shown
No one knows, no one knows, no one knows
They think I’m okay
Think I’m okay
Wanna live my life like yesterday
Never feeling down
Never feeling down
In the clouds, just stay there everyday
Never coming down
Never coming down
Life has ups and downs, just realized
(Nothing lasts forever, yeah)
One day if I fall, would you smile
(And say you’ll be there for me)
I’ve been lying awake these days
Can’t get away
Everyone changes
Every time you smile, don’t you pretend
Ask myself every night and realize things
Won’t be the same, won’t be the same
Love and fame
It seems to be enough
When the truth is not that beautiful
Tears and pain
Are things I’ve never shown
No one knows, no one knows, no one knows
That I’m not okay
I’m not okay
Wanna live my life like yesterday
Never feeling down
Never feeling down
In the clouds, just stay there everyday
Never coming down
Never coming down
Life has ups and downs, it’s alright
(Nothing lasts forever, yeah)
One day I will fall, can’t deny
(But I know you won’t leave)
Wanna live my life like yesterday
Never feeling down
Never feeling down
In the clouds, just stay there everyday
Never coming down
Never coming down
