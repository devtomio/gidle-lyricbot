Baby, why you down?
Wanna take a puff on my joint?
Don’t worry
Yea, fire a shot

Room firmly locked
Night that is swallowed by instinct
Shadow of crazy gestures
Destroy each other like an enemy

More more more, again, it’s getting out of control

Kill the truth, me and you
I can’t end anything

Not being able to leave a trace
The X-file that needs to be destroyed
Hide it so that no one can find it
Dirty love’s color, dark

Dark, dark

Ya, I’m crazy for you (What?)
Kiss me (Uh huh)
Don’t you know it is a show anyway?

Sometimes I think
Why not just be evil?
People get sick if they are nice
Why not be evil instead?
But you don’t like being bad
Yes, it’s not easy to lose
Forgetting is harder for me

More more more, again, it’s getting out of control

Kill the truth, you have to
I can’t end anything

Not being able to leave a trace
The X-file that needs to be destroyed
You know where it is
The only light in this dirty world
Bye, Dark dark dark dark
