Enclose all the harsh words and feelings in the cloud
Sit down, forget,like a night’s dream
These beautiful words “we” “you” now
There are no more, don’t know
After one day they have all disappear
If we gather the painful rainwater
Shall we go between the little stars?
You were my life
You were like you were my ocean now
What’s your name
Oh what’s your name

What’s your name
Let’s forget it all
Your name
Let’s forget it all
What’s your name
Let’s forget it all
What’s your name

What’s your name
Drop it stronger
Your name
Drop it quicker
What’s your name
Drop it louder
Drop it

Erasing, erasing your eyes
Emptying, emptying your body
Cooler than this
Cooler

I’ll meet many cooler men
Nastier than you who left me
Dark black thought
Will pass by like the wind
Oh sky, stop this rain
Because my eyes are blurry
What can’t you do?
Quickly wash away everything

If we gather the painful rainwater
Shall we go between the little stars?
You were my life
You were like you were my ocean now
What’s your name
Oh what’s your name

What’s your name
Let’s forget it all
Your name
Let’s forget it all
What’s your name
Let’s forget it all
What’s your name

What’s your name
Drop it stronger
Your name
Drop it quicker
What’s your name
Drop it louder
Drop it

Erasing, erasing your eyes
Emptying,emptying your body
Cooler than this
Cooler, cooler

I was happy, it was beautiful
To the point I hated erasing it
Because I loved you I can’t send you away
I’ll forget you

What’s your name
Let’s forget it all
Your name
Let’s forget it all
What’s your name
Let’s forget it all
What’s your name

What’s your name
Drop it stronger
Your name
Drop it quicker
What’s your name
Drop it louder
Drop it

Erasing, erasing your eyes
Emptying, emptying your body
Cooler than this
Cooler, cooler
