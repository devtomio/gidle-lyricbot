In the dark night, I hold onto the wind
And laugh lightly at the sudden thought of you

The crumbled memories slowly become dull
I let go of you and find myself
The lost smiles are filled back again
I forget you and find myself

Time gets too late, wait is forgotten
The love that used to be so hot, it scatters into the sky

Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?

Lovesick that’s treated like it’s fake
In front of the past every day, I as well
Forgotten emotions bring along wounds
And live in this world lifelessly
Like a smoke, the hug that was burning hot
Spring and summer that started with flutters
Winter that hurt so much
Love that nobody could think of anymore
(If I could let go)

I fold the regrets I couldn’t let go of with memories
I let go of you and find myself
Happiness I pushed aside knocks on my day
I forget you and find myself

Time gets too late, wait is forgetten
The love that used to be so hot, it scatters into the sky

Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?

Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?
Where is love?

If it was going to disappear like this
Why was it so hot?
It scatters without leaving behind a tiniest trace
Where is love?
