What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I wanna know
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I’m in love
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I wanna know
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Oh oh oh oh oh
Your fragrance makes my heart flutter
The new hand soap in the washroom
The casually-placed red blanket
That cute little puppy

I still can’t reach that height
I can’t see through the window
If a dazzling unicorn came to me
I would fly to you every night

Yeah it’s a fascination I can’t get rid of
Like a fantasy I wanna live in forever
I wanna know every single thing baby
You are oh deep inside my heart

What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I wanna know
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I’m in love
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I wanna know
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Oh oh oh oh oh

You’re my only soft sunshine
My heart’s the moonlight on you
Don’t hide your warm heart anymore
The hidden golden key is there

I wanna know your house from the porch to the rooms
What does your bed smell like?
How do you look when you’re asleep?
I’ve been really curious these days
If you say this much, I’ll understand
I wanna be one with you
I’d hate to miss a second
I wanna know you better than anyone else

Yeah it’s a fascination I can’t get rid of
Like a fantasy I wanna live in forever
I wanna know every single thing baby
You are oh deep inside my heart

What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I wanna know
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I’m in love
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I wanna know
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Oh oh oh oh oh

I’m nervous that you don’t know how I feel
Boy I just wanna fall in love with you

What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Woo babe
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I wanna know
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? I’m in love
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Yeah it’s a fascination

What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Like a fantasy
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Yeah it’s a fascination
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Like a fantasy
What’s in your house?
What’s in your house? Oh oh oh oh oh
