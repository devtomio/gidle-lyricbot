Baddest do what the baddest do
The baddest do we the baddest ooh
Baddest do what the baddest do
The baddest do we the baddest

Coming at you live
Real real wild
Here to light it up
Set the world on fire
Gonna break rules
And hearts in twos
Cause that’s what the baddest do

Never going back
Nah not that
Diamonds on drip
Cause I came to make a splash
Gonna break rules
And hearts in twos
Cause that’s what the baddest do

I spit heat, I melt your face off
Disappear, I’m your eraser
In the cut just like a razor
Murder business, where my blazer?
I got all the boys on me
I got all the lines on ring
Knock ’em dead, turnin heads
I got all the eyes on me
I walk in with a pretty face
Make ’em want a taste
Boy slow down, you gone have to wait
Dangling the bait
You like “whoa” KALI you the goat
I’m like “yeah, I know”
Gotta bounce cause I like to ball
Man I’m on a roll
Keep it lit mega like a bit
I mean like a byte
Get it right, know I do it big
I ain’t talking height
I’m legit, know I leave ’em dead
I’m a boss, extra with the sauce
Give ’em what they like

I’m doing damage
Went just how I planned it
I do what I want when I say
I’m making the news
But this ain’t nothing new
(Like) to live on the edge of insane

Coming at you live
Real real wild
Here to light it up
Set the world on fire
Gonna break rules
And hearts in twos
Cause that’s what the baddest do

Never going back
Nah not that
Diamonds on drip
Cause I came to make a splash
Gonna break rules
And hearts in twos
Cause that’s what the baddest do

(It’s crazy)
Sorry for the bad news sorry I’m so bad
Only took a minute for me to get what you had
Sorry for the bad news know it makes you sad
I’ll be here for a minute baby you should pack your bags

Way that I look should be breaking the law
If I don’t got it I take what I want
My circle small like a round of applause
You know that I love the sound of applause
You know I mean everything that I say
When you see me coming get out of the way
I came to slay I came to slay
back and I’m better and ready to stay

I’m doing damage
Went just how I planned it
I do what I want when I say
I’m making the news
But this ain’t nothing new
(Like) to live on the edge of insane

(It’s crazy)
Sorry not sorry for being the best
I came to stunt came to impress
Look at the gold all on my chest
Look at the gold call it a flex
