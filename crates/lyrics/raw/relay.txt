My heart goes boom boom, the lights go bang bang
No more room to step back anymore
My feet go boom boom, hearing the shouts yeah yeah
Get out of the way, no such thing as failure for me

You'll think of me again
Like magic, yeah! (la la la la la la la la)
Yes, it won't be easy but just watch
Can you feel lit? We're becoming one

Run fast, shout out loud like that
The shouts are ringing in your head like an alarm
You don't have to feel bad, there's still mo' laps
But we're the winners anyway, sorry not sorry

It's alright alright, yeah you and me
Yeah that's right that's right, together like this
Feel the wind, run as fast as you can
The sunshine is dazzling if I'm with you

Oh oh oh oh keep runnin and runnin and
Oh oh oh oh till you go far ahead
Oh oh oh oh keep runnin and runnin and
Oh oh oh oh keep running till the end

Shout out loud hey hey, follow me, yeah yeah
Are you tired? Then shout like this
This spirit ay ay, till the end run run
Give up? Never, you have us

Aren't you curious about that smile from the last winner?
If you close your eyes, you'll see us smiling
No need to worry
Putting all our powers together
No need to be afraid (la la la la la la la la)

Run fast, shout out loud like that
The shouts are ringing in your head like an alarm
You don't have to feel bad, there's still mo' laps
But we're the winners anyway, sorry not sorry

It's alright alright, yeah you and me
Yeah that's right that's right, together like this
Feel the wind, run as fast as you can
The sunshine is dazzling if I'm with you

Oh oh oh oh keep runnin and runnin and
Oh oh oh oh till you go far ahead
Oh oh oh oh keep runnin and runnin and
Oh oh oh oh keep running till the end
Let's go

It's our own chemistry (oh chemi) you know
Because it's us, it's possible, let's run till the end
Run even more till the end
Woah woah

It's alright alright, yeah you and me
Yeah that's right that's right, together like this
Feel the wind, run as fast as you can
The sunshine is dazzling if I'm with you

Oh oh oh oh keep runnin and runnin and
Oh oh oh oh till you go far ahead
Oh oh oh oh keep runnin and runnin and
Oh oh oh oh keep running till the end
