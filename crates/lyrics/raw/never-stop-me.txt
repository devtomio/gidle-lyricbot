I feel drugged, spattered luxury bag
Lips that ripped big
Both of my eyes are spreading like smoky, yeah
Yeah, baby I knew it
I'm leaving, so goodbye, not crazy
What's wrong with cursing in such a pretty mouth?
I'm always nasty
Did you want me to be a stupid angel until the end?

You broke my heart, you locked my love
I can't believe I'm tearing up
No, I'm not okay at all
Let me put on leather jacket

Mama, don't ever, ever stop me
Regardless of what I've done
Mama, don't еver, ever stuck mе
Never stop me, ooh-woah-oh-oh, ooh-woah-oh-oh

La, la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la, la-la-la
Surprise

Your pants, I bought it
Take off your black socks
Her gift, mini pill
Can't you control what you want?
Hell no, does he know that?
Any bed the red car
Scolded by daddy, out of company
Looking forward to your wedding

You broke my heart, you locked my love
I get goosebumps 'cause I'm shameless
I'm not at all okay with it yet
Let me fire last rocket

Mama, don't ever, ever stop me
Regardless of what I've done
Mama, don't ever, ever stuck me
Never stop me, ooh-woah-oh-oh, ooh-woah-oh-oh

Get rid of it, that's a good ending
I know, I do not regret kicking the blanket (Screw you dummy)
Since then, you probably don't know it

La, la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la
La, la, la-la-la
(I know I'm too emotional)
La, la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la
Nobody can never stop me

I feel like I lost my mind
Spilled ice coffee
Curved red lip
And the smoky you hated
