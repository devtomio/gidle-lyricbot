As if in the dead of winter
The time has completely frozen
Which seems to be left by the cruel wind
The darkness deepens

Shall break out
From this endless season with no promise
Shall erase
The scars solely burnt from the days we were not in love

I shall ignite a fire
So that my tears dwelling inside won’t live any longer
I shall make a fire, a bigger fire
To win back spring that I’ve lost

The cold wind, and the heart covered in white snow
May please melt completely when the morning comes
Light up a fire

HWAA (Fire)
Burn burn
HWAA (Fire)
Shall bloom a flower

HWAA (Fire)
Burn burn
HWAA (Fire)
Shall bloom a flower

I shall never let your trace leave a mark
Shall burn the resentment left undone
And shall take away the lonesome cold
Step over the withered flower path
Once I untangle han, shall feel the spring once again
All memories turn into ashes
Then shall bloom a beautiful bright flower

I shall make a fire, a bigger fire
To win back spring that I’ve lost

The cold wind, and the heart covered in white snow
May please melt completely when the morning comes
Light up a fire

HWAA (Fire)
Burn burn
HWAA (Fire)
Shall bloom a flower

HWAA (Fire)
Burn burn
HWAA (Fire)
Shall bloom a flower

By holding the regrets of broken fate
Burn myself with fire of the heartbreaking times

HWAA (Flower)
HWAA (Flower)
Light up a fire

Shall bloom a flower
