The night with the bright moon, me who couldn’t hide
At the red moonlight, my tears
And my facial expression can be seen

Do not shine on me, oh, moon
Moon, I want this place to be dark still
Do not come near me, oh, moon
So that I can remove my smile for a while

Turn off the moonlight
Please don’t let it shine
So that till the morning comes
Nobody can see me
Please hide me

The night with the bright moon, me who couldn’t forget
At the blue sky
That smile and that face can be seen

Do not shine on me, oh, moon
Moon, please, I want to be alone in this place
Do not come near me, oh, moon
So that I can reduce my sadness for a while

Turn off the moonlight
Please don’t let it shine
So that till the morning comes
Nobody can see me
Please hide me

Dum dum dum darirari dum dum darum
Dum dum dum darirari dum dum da da
Dum dum dum darirari dum dum darum
Dum dum dum darirari dum dum da

Red moon
Please take me to the sky
So that in your dark universe
I can hide this star
Please hide me

The night with the bright moon, me who couldn’t cry
