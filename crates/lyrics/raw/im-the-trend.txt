I don’t need a perfume even though I don’t wear it
Butterflies gather around me all the time
I don’t wear fancy clothes but whatever I wear
Everything is sold out calm down

Everyone, check this out
I’m everything you wish to be, endured the
Intense PRODUCE 101, Unpretty Rapstar and Queendom
And exceeded my limits
My charms allure, shakes, seizes and steals your heart
And your life becomes mine
Yeah, from awesome, beautiful, and cool I eat off everything
Yeah i’M THE TREND

i’M THE TREND, wherever we go
It never ends, can’t you see that line
Look at those violet lights waiting for me
‘Oh my god’

I’m gonna ‘Blow Your Mind’
And make your everyday ‘LATATA’
I’m a queen like a ‘LION’
You better move like woh ‘Uh-Oh’

I’m gonna ‘Blow Your Mind’
And make your everyday ‘LATATA’
Now you’re in my ‘MAZE’
You better move like ‘Senorita’

I’m getting busier and the time is indifferent
But I actually have a clear mind
Following the bright thoughts in my head
Everyone imitates us, (G)I-DLE

Sawadika I’m Kim Minnie
I’ve got countless charms
A left-hended Thai but they think I’m Korean
Becuz of my pretty handwriting
Now I need my own font
I have more but that’s it for now
Nicha Yontararak khawp khun kha

i’M THE TREND, wherever we go
It never ends, can’t you see that line
Look at those redlights waiting for me
‘Oh my god’

I’m gonna ‘Blow Your Mind’
And make your everyday ‘LATATA’
I’m a queen like a ‘LION’
You better move like woh ‘Uh-Oh’

I’m gonna ‘Blow Your Mind’
And make your everyday ‘LATATA’
Now you’re in my ‘MAZE’
You better move like
Hey señor

Move two steps to your left
Raise your hands and
Make ’em clap clap, just follow me
Now this time, move two steps to your right
Let your body move again
Let your body move

i’M THE TREND, wherever we go
It never ends, can’t you see that line
Look at those violet lights waiting for me
‘Oh my god’

And make your everyday ‘LATATA’
I’m a queen like a ‘LION’
You better move like woh ‘Uh-Oh’

I’m gonna ‘Blow Your Mind’

Now you’re in my ‘MAZE’
You better move like ‘Senorita’
