Red five diamonds in my bag
If you wanna see it, dance to beat like that
My mama saw it and oh my God, dang
Okay, I’ll show you what’s in my bag

Red five diamonds in my bag
If you wanna see it, dance to beat like that
My mama saw it and oh my God, dang
Okay, I’ll show you what’s in my bag

Uh-oh, I know you like it
My voice, no need to say it, God dang
Uh-oh, I just like it
Since birth, I ain’t interested in money

The eyes of a bad criminal being rude on stage
“Fantasy” is banned from everyone except for me
All the Persimmon fruit that you ate are just rice for me
Taste the strong vibe sugar high, taste it, evеryone die

Rum-rum-rum-rumble (Ah) all crumblе (Yeah)
This voice is no lose to the drum
No, no, no lovely, I’m Bumblebee
It just goes in a sudden, don’t do it one, two

I never had fear AKA giant dog, oopsie, you’ll get hurt if you stroke me like this, how can this be?
I value my love, stop beating you
The water is completely different from
the empty-headed idiots, yeah, you know

Red five diamonds in my bag
If you wanna see it, dance to beat like that
My mama saw it and oh my God, dang
Okay, I’ll show you what’s in my bag

Red five diamonds in my bag
If you wanna see it, dance to beat like that
My mama saw it and oh my God, dang
Okay, I’ll show you what’s in my bag

The light one, no, no
In fear dumb-dumb (Woo)
To the bad guys, woof-woof (Woof-woof, yeah)
Yeah, bring it on, come, come

I’m a cool lady’s one and only character, you’re the one who’s trembling between unnie and boss baby
Overflowing jealousy
But that’s too early
It’s bothersome to even mention
That my skin is young

Being a princess, probably a crime
An overflowing bullet penetrates my heart
The scent is like rose and beautiful red
Your angry thorns, blood, yeah

Ain’t gonna read messages that I haven’t read yet
Leave your empty hopes over there
You know, know, know, know, know, know
Say no, no, no, no, no, no

Red five diamonds in my bag
If you wanna see it, dance to beat like that
My mama saw it and oh my God, dang
Okay, I’ll show you what’s in my bag

Red five diamonds in my bag
If you wanna see it, dance to beat like that
My mama saw it and oh my God, dang
Okay, I’ll show you what’s in my bag
