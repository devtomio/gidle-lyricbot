There is no ending to this long cold season
There’s not a single flower, I’m still the same from back then

The resolve to forget you
Wavers from one wind
As if the promise to erase you… was a lie as well

Not a day went by without thinking about you
I missed you yesterday, so I resent you today
As if you trusted the cold me from that day
You don’t even look back

Lalalalalalala lala
Lalalalalalala lala
Is it my greed… to wait for your spring again?

The moon hung between the trees… grows bigger many times
At the moonlight that melts the heartbreak
Only my tears fill up

Not a day went by without thinking about you
I miss you today, so I resent you tomorrow
As if you trusted the cold me from that day
You don’t even look back

Lalalalalalala lala
Lalalalalalala lala
Lalalalalalala lala
Lalalalalalala lala

Is it my greed… to wait for your spring again?
