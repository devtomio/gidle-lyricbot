It’s even worse today
I can’t sleep, I’m tossing and turning
How can you text me like that?
As if everything’s ok, you say hello
A relationship that I thought I’d never have again
Was it just a joke to you?
All the sighs and the endings that I spit out
Do you not know?
I’m getting angry at your text
Maybe I didn’t know you as well as I thought I did
But I don’t wanna know anymore
Cuz our time together has stopped at that place, at that time

Like nothing special, we became strangers
Now everything has changed
We’ve frozen in place
Don’t text me

Oh never, I don’t wanna reply
What do you want from me now?
I don’t wanna know how you feel
Please erase me and my number

Stop when the good memories remain
Say goodbye to all the feelings
I’m going back to when you weren’t here
Don’t text me, goodbye

It was so good back then
But it’s all in the past
Let’s just live separately

Random messages late at night
Why are you asking what I’m doing
Should’ve been good to me while you had me, am I that easy?
Now stop and wake up

Like nothing special, we became strangers
Now everything has changed
We’ve frozen in place
Don’t text me

Oh never, I don’t wanna reply
What do you want from me now?
I don’t wanna know how you feel
Please erase me and my number

Stop when the good memories remain
Say goodbye to all the feelings
I’m going back to when you weren’t here
Don’t text me, goodbye

It was so good back then
But it’s all in the past
Let’s just live separately

I liked it too when I was the only in your eyes
Seeing how easy it is for you
To talk about something so hard
I guess you’re really over me
It hurt but I don’t wanna erase the memories
So even though you were a jerk, I don’t hate you
So I won’t reply
Just pass over me as a beautiful memory

Oh never, I don’t wanna reply
What do you want from me now?
I don’t wanna know how you feel
Please erase me and my number

Stop when the good memories remain
Say goodbye to all the feelings
I’m going back to when you weren’t here
Don’t text me, goodbye

It was so good back then
But it’s all in the past
Let’s just live separately
