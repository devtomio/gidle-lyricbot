Lately I have been, for some reason
I’ve been feeling lonely, even though I’m close to you
The way you used to be
Where has it gone now?

Before I realized it, things had changed
Being alone with you has now become awkward
I can’t see it anymore
The person I loved
The person I was familiar with
Slowly slowly, everything became blurry

I was too aware of everything
Even being by your side doesn’t make my heart flutter
An everyday with an unsaid goodbye
Even when I’m filled by you, Tung Tung, I’m empty
Even if I’m satisfied, now Tung Tung, I’m empty

I don’t understand well
Now, we are just passing by each other
But I still love you
So, who was the one
That changed?

I was too aware of everything
Even being by your side doesn’t make my heart flutter
An everyday with an unsaid goodbye
Even when I’m filled by you, Tung Tung, I’m empty
Even if I’m satisfied, now Tung Tung, I’m empty

It’s not the end, right?
We can still go back to how it was, right?
It’s only this one moment, right?
We will get through this, right?
There are still so many things I want to do
Even now, our love is supposed to have continued
Being told something by someone isn’t good
When I think of us parting ways
My heart hurts like it is getting ripped apart

I was too aware of everything
Even being by your side doesn’t make my heart flutter
An everyday with an unsaid goodbye
Even when I’m filled by you, Tung Tung, I’m empty
Even if I’m satisfied, now Tung Tung, I’m empty
