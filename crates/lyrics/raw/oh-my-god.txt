Beneath the dazzling sky covering my eyes
I run into your arms
I was drawn into the music
And fall right into it
Help me help me
As if I’m out of breath I feel
Set me free set me free
As if I’m gonna melt, so sick

Fall head over heels and you toy with my heart
And destroy my reason and let yourself in
Dangerous yet I want to own it and hold onto this pain
Still I let you in

Oh my god
She took me to the sky
Oh my god
She showed me all the stars

Baby baby
As if you rush into me, come in
Make me make me
As if I would go insane, like it

Oh god how could you
Put me into this temptation, is it a call from hell?
Can’t stop how could I get away from her
Temperance you gave is in dark black hole
Severely torn apart and became a fool
Can’t be controlled just like sugar-coated drug
If this is sin, I’ll then pay the piper
Insanely beautiful yet seems like a devil

You make me to lose my mind
And let yourself in
Blaze up like fireworks love you till I would get burned
Still I let you in

Oh my god
She took me to the sky
Oh my god
She showed me all the stars

I color myself with strong purple scent
And spread across the entire sky
I print dark red love on my face
And whatever people say Fall in love

Oh my god
She took me to the sky
Oh my god
She showed me all the stars

Beneath the dazzling sky covering my eyes
I run into your arms
I was drawn into the music
And fall right into it
