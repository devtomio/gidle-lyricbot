Ooh I’m a lion I’m a queen, no one
Yes, nothing can confine me, even pain
Fire under the red sun
A blue flower burning
I’m here to play hard to get
Sharp claws are revealed
Wounds burning up
Footsteps lingering beside my crown

I cover my eyes and feel this music
Destroy the boring rhythm and devote a lion’s dance
You look into my eyes and feel threatened by this music
Trapped in the burning hot rhythm and devote a lion’s dance

Bababa bababa bababa
It looks like a lion
I’m a queen like a lion
Bababa bababa bababa
It looks like a lion
I’m a queen like a lion

That tough roar makes you come back to me
In this vast wilderness I spread my large firm seeds
That mighty roar makes you come back to me
To this deep dark ocean the rough melody pierces your ears

Don’t seek what you can’t have, a lion holding the fort
I may turn violent
Now turn up the cheers, everyone look up
The young lion takes its crown

I cover my eyes and feel this music
Destroy the boring rhythm and devote a lion’s dance
You look into my eyes and feel threatened by this music
Trapped in the burning hot rhythm and devote a lion’s dance

Bababa bababa bababa
It looks like a lion
I’m a queen like a lion
Bababa bababa bababa
It looks like a lion
I’m a queen like a lion

I’ll bite off your useless courtesy
We tear down your suffocating prejudice
Who would dare to stop me Who would dare to control me
Careful With my sharp claws
I create a new path no one has attempted before
All those condescending people will click their tongues
But the applause I receive after breaking that prejudice is thrilling
I’ve had a taste Now I can’t deny it I’m a queen

Bababa bababa bababa
It looks like a lion
I’m a queen like a lion
Bababa bababa bababa
It looks like a lion
I’m a queen like a lion

Ooh I’m a lion I’m a queen, no one
Yes, nothing can tame me, even love
