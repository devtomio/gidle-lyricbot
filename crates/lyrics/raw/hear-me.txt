It’s hard to take back what I said
I’m here waiting
But I don’t see you
You looked at me with your cold gaze
I feel really strange
I know I can’t help it anymore
The night sky darkens
Like me, like my heart
It dims, can I have your heart?

Just this once
Listen to what I have to say
From deep inside my heart
I want you to listen to me

We’re a bit more distant but it’s okay
I push you away but it’s okay
I’m always here
Like a fool, I wait to see you

I really hate how stained you are
I’m here shouting
But you don’t hear me
You wrapped me up and held me
I feel like our precious memories are over now
But I hate ending it like this

Those stars disappear
It looks sad but my heart’s okay
I won’t turn my back on you

Just this once
Listen to what I have to say
From deep inside my heart
I want you to listen to me

We’re a bit more distant but it’s okay
I push you away but it’s okay
I’m always here
Like a fool, I wait to see you

Why are you leaving me?
Have I ever been this honest?
Let me tell you honestly
If this is the end for us
Will you ever come back?

Please come back
Always stay by my side
I couldn’t get the words out of my mouth
But I really wanted to tell you

I hate how we’ve become a bit more distant
Please don’t push me away
I’ll wait for you
I love you, I love you
