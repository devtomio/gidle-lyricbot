It’s time to upgrade! Let’s go!

Every day tomorrow comforts me
Smile, before the tears dry
Ah ah you've holding up well

I will be your friend
Everyone need place to lean on for a while
It's okay to breath slowly for a while
So you can think for a while

My friends out there to the blue sky
Like peeling it off, stretch your hand
Hands up both of your hands high to the sky

It's not enough to be alone to pass the wall
How about gather the strength?
It's time to upgrade
Flying higher than us
But don't be afraid it's only for a while
What about pass the line?
It's time to upgrade than today upgrade
I won't be afraid of the road we will pass tomorrow

I couldn't pass that wall alone as I'm small
I need you beside me.
I want to go up with you,
higher than the dream
Follow that bright sun
Gather the two hands on that shining star
Pray for the better tomorrow

The feeling of walking alone is only for a while
There is one more left of the footsteps
Raise the fire on my heart
Lacks of the power if alone, if we are together, I'm not afraid
There is no time to hesitate time is gold

It's not enough to be alone to pass the wall
How about gather the strength?
It's time to upgrade
Flying higher than us
But don't be afraid it's only for a while
What about pass the line?
It's time to upgrade than today upgrade
I won't be afraid of the road we will pass tomorrow

Even though we sometimes stagger
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Hold my hand

It won't always be difficult
Let's be together promise promise me
It's not enough to be alone to pass the wall
How about gather the strength?
It's time to upgrade
Flying higher than us
But don't be afraid it's only for a while
What about pass the line?
It's time to upgrade than today upgrade
I won't be afraid of the road we will pass tomorrow

The memories of being hurt
Forget everything after this night pass
I will be fine I will be fine
So there won't be the day I hurt anymore
