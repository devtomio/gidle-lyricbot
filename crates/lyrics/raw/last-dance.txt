Even if I die as if I will die
Even if I call out to you as if my voice will rip
Even if I’m standing at the edge of a cliff
It doesn’t matter anymore

A fragile figure under the red moon
My breath is rising to the tip of my chin
Suddenly, the night has grown so deep
My heart is hot, she got the bomb

It was cold as ice, as if nothing was wrong
I stepped on the rough land and came to this world
I was innocent like a fool, as if bewitched by something
I already fell into this game, I couldn’t stop

Now I’m back home
Don’t stop, run toward the light
Just like this, I’m staying in this eternal time
She is no longer

All day, last dance
All day, last dance
All day, last dance

Disappearing into the exciting heat
I’ll cover your secrets in the darkness
Drunk with all five senses and lost, hello
Hold up hold up

Disappearing into the exciting heat
I’ll cover your secrets in the darkness
I’ll help you believe in this existence in front of you
Hold up, smash!

That night colored with the aurora
Let’s do the last dance
My heart has stopped and I have awakened
Let’s do the last dance
The light spills down, the air focuses on us
The moon heats up to a red color, we need some music
When morning comes, I’ll push back tomorrow
Let’s dance till our feet are on fire
So we can burn this night even more

It was cold as ice, as if nothing was wrong
I stepped on the rough land and came to this world
I was innocent like a fool, as if bewitched by something
I already fell into this game, I couldn’t stop

Now I’m back home
Don’t stop, run toward the light
Just like this, I’m staying in this eternal time
She is no longer

All day, last dance
All day, last dance
All day, last dance

Disappearing into the exciting heat
I’ll cover your secrets in the darkness
Drunk with all five senses and lost, hello
Hold up hold up

Disappearing into the exciting heat
I’ll cover your secrets in the darkness
I’ll help you believe in this existence in front of you
Hold up, smash!
