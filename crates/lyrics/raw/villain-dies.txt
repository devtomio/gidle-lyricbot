Once upon a time, there was a villain
Who is a villain?

A mouth filled with candy, strawberry
As if this is my last meal, it stings but still sweet
(I’m) stupid and filthy, but she’s okay
No matter how many times I shoot, they don’t hit, it’s okay

Why don’t you love me, look here
This beautiful
When will this crazy story end

If the villain dies
(Okay, Bullet, Love, Die)

Heroine is mine
I’ll never die
Even if it’s your sad ending
Heroine is mine
I’ll never die
Even if it’s your sad ending

You put me down and want me dead
In fact, you don’t even know me that well
I never cry, but I was in pain yesterday as well
cuz of her
Who is the villain, that villain was me
I hated her, who ruined everything
But this story’s villain was me

Hey yo god or author
I’m goin’ to hell but not alone
Driven crazy, my play will change this ending
Hey yo god or author I’m goin’ to hell
but not alone no no no

Why do you love her, look here
Even though (she’s) always hurting me
When will this crazy story end

If the villain dies
(Okay, Bullet, Love, Die)

Heroine is mine
I’ll never die
Even if it’s your sad ending
Heroine is mine
I’ll never die
Even if it’s your sad ending

I won’t leave it flow like this
A fun ending, see closely
The villain’s laugh and a sad last page
Oh right oh right, write

Never die
