Hey ex-boyfriend (Hey, ex)
You keep spying on my Instagram (Uh, hmm-mm, uh)
You hope to get back? (Get back?)
You know, my life is perfect

Right after world tour, magazines, radio, even commercials
I don't think I'll even have a minute to spare-ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Now, how much do I owe you?
Did I love you forgot it (Yeah)

Now, I'm amazing I feel crazy
I found a wonderful life
I feel like I'm in love with me now, ah
Wanna be married? It was crazy
The fact I wanted such a wonderful love?
That's crazy (Crazy)
Thanks, breaking up the love

Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love (Okay)
I'm lucky, lost the love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love (Okay)
Thanks, breaking up the love

Back in those days
I used to cry all night
I lived in my dream
I tried to make you regret it (Mm-mm-mm)

I am sure you heard, yeah from "TOMBOY," now to "Nxde"
Even when I see it, I'm impressed-ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Now even if you run into that girl who took you away
Anyway (Yeah)

Now, I'm amazing I feel crazy
I found a wonderful life
I feel like I'm in love with me now, ah
Wanna be married? It was crazy
The fact I wanted such a wonderful love?
That's crazy (Crazy)
Thanks, breaking up the love

Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love (Okay)
I'm lucky, lost the love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love
Thanks, breaking up the love

I'm lucky, found my love, love, love
You'll never make me cry like that day again
I think I also have a wonderful lover-ah-ah
Thank you for helping me find real love
My love is (Guess who?)
That's me, she's my love

Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love (Okay)
I'm lucky, lost the love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
