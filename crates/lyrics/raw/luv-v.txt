You, don’t laugh so sensually
Cause it’s quite dangerous (Danger)
Don’t stare at me so intensely too
Cause it’s so hot (So hot)

Someone please stop you
I get electrocuted by your gaze
Feels like I will jump into your embrace
No matter how people keep teaching me that it’s bad
I can’t hear them, like a delinquent
(You are foxy) You come for my rationale
(I’m stupid) and I get lured by your stupidity
I don’t want to resist you, already Fall in Luv

By the sweet wind that blows hard
The high wall crumbles down easily
My feelings have risen up till I cannot
Swallow them back down, I can’t take it anymore

I love you

I Luv U Luv U Luv U
Baby baby
I Luv U Luv U Luv U
Baby baby

Fall deeper so I get
Crazy over you, OK

You, don’t act stupid
Because it’s kind of cute
Don’t get close to me sneakily too
Cause my face heats up

That natural touch Oh bomb bomb
Makes my heart explode
Makes it bigger every second
Even when I act calmly, I fail yet again
How can you keep teasing me like this
Don’t knock on the door with a bad smile
My glass-like heart break easily
No, actually it’s already open
You can just come in
I don’t care I already Luv U

By the sweet wind that blows hard
The high wall crumbles down easily
My feelings have risen up till I cannot
Swallow them back down, I can’t take it anymore

I love you

I Luv U Luv U Luv U
Babe babe
I Luv U Luv U Luv U
Babe babe

My Luv that turned red
My Luv that fell into danger

I love you

I Luv U Luv U Luv U
Baby baby
I Luv U Luv U Luv U
Baby baby
