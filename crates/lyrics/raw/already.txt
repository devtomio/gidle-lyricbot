I'm alone in this room for so so long
With thoughts about you
I'm making a song like this
My phone is ringing at this late hour
Why are you saying you're sorry now?
Even a second is too late (Too late)
If you hadn't told me that lie
And if I had endured that last word
Would we have been together? (But now)
Already, already, already over ah ah ah ah
I've erased you Ah ah ah ah
That day then
Already, already, already over ah ah ah ah
That last day Ah ah ah ah
The end, it's how our story ends
I never missed you, even on this lonely night
Love is lost and the 'us' of that day is gone
The beginning and end of the love that always depended on you
The way you pretend to be kind is the same
I'm sick of it because I knew your true nature
No more fools who were satisfied with the seat next to them
I don't know my yesterday, I spit it out with tears
Okay, even if you really changed, I'm already-
You never know what I've been through
I cried and cried and wanted to hang on
I know in the end, it won't be us
It's never going to be the same (Again)
Already, already, already over ah ah ah ah
I've erased you Ah ah ah ah
That day then
Already, already, already over ah ah ah ah
That last day Ah ah ah ah
The end, it's how our story ends
Already, already, already over ah ah ah ah
I've erased you Ah ah ah ah
That day then
Already, already, already over ah ah ah ah
That last day Ah ah ah ah
The end, it's how our story ends
The movie comes to an end
The main characters have our names41
In the black screen
I slowly rise into
