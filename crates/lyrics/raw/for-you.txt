Because mind and words were contrary
I’m still regretting now
Couldn’t say what I wanted to convey
So please meet in my dream, however
At that time, I couldn’t keep up my courage
I couldn’t do anything for you

I can’t live without you
I love you
What makes this gap so empty
Boy, oh there is no one like you
No one but you
No one can stop it, oh
My love is you

As it’s like the lyrics send to you
Even the feelings is distressful
If that promise doesn’t have any meaning
Only memories stay in my mind

No matter how I tried to forget
Even when I closed my eyes, I could hear the footsteps
I give a gentle smile

I can’t live without you
I love you
Only warmth left
Boy, oh there is no one like you
No one but you
No one can be over you, oh
My love is you

Someday, if there is anyone else other than me
Please don’t forget me like I do
If we have forgiven
Only once, let’s meet again

I can’t live without you
I love you
What makes this gap so empty, oh
There is no one can replace you
Always you
No one can bury it, oh
My love is you

Because mind and words were contrary
My beloved that was by my side
