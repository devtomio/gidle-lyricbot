Just say no
Just tell me that you don’t love me
Like my heart is going to leave
Like I’m going to hate you
Just say yes
No, I mean tell me you’re in love
Just like the good times
Can’t you love me now?

Your eyes give me an answer
I’m just sighing as if I’m sorry
That’s how it collapses
I’m falling apart

I’m gonna stop time with you
But I can’t see the future I drawn
It breaks like a dream
It’s all broken

Darkness, heart bruising
If you look at the day when my tears fell
Will you go away? Will I go away from you?
I filled your heart that I love
I think I’m going to die
Will you go away? Will I go away from you?

It hurts ah yah ah ah yah
It hurts ah yah ah ah yah
It hurts ah yah ah ah yah
It hurts ah yah ah ah yah

Just say no
Just tell me everything, honestly
That’s what changed, isn’t it?
I hate it

Where’s the start of this?
I can’t help but cry, tears under my feet
Everything collapses
I’m falling apart

With past memories that I have
I ask you again even though I know
Is this how it ends?
Are we done now?

Darkness, heart bruising
If you look at the day when my tears fell
Will you go away? Will I go away from you?
I filled your heart that I love
I think I’m going to die
Will you go away? Will I go away from you?

It hurts ah yah ah ah yah
It hurts ah yah ah ah yah
It hurts ah yah ah ah yah
It hurts ah yah ah ah yah

Just say no
Just tell me that you don’t love me
Like my heart is going to leave
Like I’m going to hate you

Just say yes
No, I mean tell me you’re in love
Just like the good times
Can’t you love me now?
