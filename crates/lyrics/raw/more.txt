Should we show ’em how we do it everyday
(na na na na na na na na na na)
Let’s get it

Akali that girl, Kali go grr
Kali don’t stop, Kali don’t skrr
Kali got a job, Kali go to work
Always on fire, don’t get burnt
I’m giving you more than a buffet
I’m slaying all day like I’m Buffy
I scoot in and school on my huffy
You up against me, that’s a rough day
I’m giving you more cause I’m greater than
I don’t do mathematics, I hated them
But all of my numbers are talking babe
Got money like Mrs. Monopoly
Got more like I’m doing addition, real money
And I don’t need no one to give me permission
Go get it go get it go get it the mission
You never look at me and say something’s missing
Cause I got it different

All I’ll ever know
Is life up on a throne
I don’t do the middle or a little
You want

More
Know I got it so here you go
You look like you could use some more
Know I got it and never running low
Yeah I got
More than enough add it up and away
You know I got it like
Bomb bomb blow your mind
Never giving less and that’s how it’ll stay
You know I got it like
All day, all the time

When I go it’s for gold
Yeah they cool but I’m cold
I don’t fit in the mold
I’m a rebel
I don’t do what you say
Making moves I don’t wait
While I smile in your face
I got different DNA

What’s higher than the top, that’s me
Come take a look
Before falling at my feet
Cause that’s the only drop they’ll be
So take a look
Better recognize a queen

All I’ll ever know
Is life up on a throne
I don’t do the middle or a little
You want

More
Know I got it so here you go
You look like you could use some more
Know I got it and never running low
Yeah I got
More than enough add it up and away
You know I got it like
Bomb bomb blow your mind
Never giving less and that’s how it’ll stay
You know I got it like
All day, All the time

Way out
Feeling like an ocean, on the wave now
Feeling like I’m floating, never weighed down
This is how I do it everyday
Wow, wow
But I know I know
You want some more
I know what you been asking for
I know I know, you want some more
If you ready let’s go
Giving it all

More
Know I got it so here you go
You look like you could use some more
Know I got it and never running low
Yeah I got
More than enough add it up and away
You know I got it like
Bomb bomb blow your mind
Never giving less and that’s how it’ll stay
You know I got it like
All day, All the time
