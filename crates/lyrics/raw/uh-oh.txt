Hey
There’s someone trying to be close to me
Ya, I’m talking about you
Uh-oh who is that over there
Uh-oh you know me?
Uh-oh well, I forgot

You’re so ridiculous
I’m a little taken back
Uh-oh, stop going around acting like we’re friends

Uh-uh-oh don’t touch me, stay away
What do you want from me? You’re all the same
Someone like you? I don’t know at all
Uh-uh-oh did you fall for me? You’re all the same

Being caring and generous, saying angelic hellos?
Sweetly sugar-coated words?
How rude, stop acting nice, go away
Don’t come here and act all fake now

Lingering around me, trying to talk to me, bat-like followers
Liars who say they knew I’d succeed
I can’t believe it, stop acting like we’re friends, go away
Don’t expect me to act fake for you

What a mess, only see now
You didn’t know there would be a swan inside this duckling
Blow out the candles on the cake
And put the crown on my head

Yo I told you, the gem of this place is me, hurry and invest
You’ve only been looking for what shines
And you missed me, who will light this place up

Uh uh uh uh uh uh
No no no no no no
You’re no good, you’re even worse, ok that’s enough, go away

Uh-uh-oh don’t touch me, stay away
What do you want from me? You’re all the same
Someone like you? I don’t know at all
Uh-uh-oh did you fall for me? You’re all the same

Being caring and generous, saying angelic hellos?
Sweetly sugar-coated words?
How rude, stop acting nice, go away
Don’t come here and act all fake now

Lingering around me, trying to talk to me, bat-like followers
Liars who say they knew I’d succeed
I can’t believe it, stop acting like we’re friends, go away
Don’t expect me to act fake for you

Uh-oh it’s unbelievable
Uh-oh untouchable
Uh-oh like something’s gone wrong

Yo you got it
Don’t mess with me
Umm I’m not finished
Ok let’s go

No one knew
About this masterpiece, this masterpiece
About this melody oh melody that would repeat on your lips
So perfect, my A to Z, oh A to Z
I love my fans, yeah L-O-V-E yeah L-O-V-E

Uh-oh
