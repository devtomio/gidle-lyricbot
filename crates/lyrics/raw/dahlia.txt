You’re so beautiful
I fall in love from just looking at you
When I just pass by you
I fall in deeper at your sweet scent
So fascinated

Your wide smile… hidden behind the glamour
Your true self hidden behind it
Will it be as pretty as how it looks?
Don’t trust, Dahlia, it’s dangerous, Darling
I want to keep you to myself and see you

My love is Dahlia
Our love is Dahlia, oh
I’m drunk on the flower called you
No matter what they say
I’ll choose to love you anyway, oh
Cuz you’re my Dahlia

Love is whim, I jump into love again
My name is fool, I throw myself even as I know it’ll change
The footsteps drunk on the red scent
Without stopping once, are running
Towards you, in the embrace that’s as yellow as starlight
The color of love that gets deeper
It gets deeper till I can’t go back, bring down all the walls
Everything is stolen from me, in this moment, I pray to God
Hope this flower stays beautiful forever

Your wide smile… hidden behind the glamour
Your true self hidden behind it
Will it be as pretty as how it looks?
Don’t trust, Dahlia, it’s dangerous, Darling
I want to keep you to myself and see you

My love is Dahlia
Our love is Dahlia oh
I’m drunk on the flower called you
No matter what they say
I’ll choose to love you anyway, oh
Cuz you’re my Dahlia

I’m slowly colored by you
In my deepening heart
It’s getting filled up by you
Like a blooming flower

My love is Dahlia
Our love is Dahlia, oh
I can’t escape from you
No matter what they say
I’ll let me love you anyway, oh
Cuz you’re my Dahlia

You’re so beautiful
When I just look at you
When I just pass by you
I fall for the fascinating scent
Keep falling
