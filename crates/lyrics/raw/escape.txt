Look into the sky
What do you see?
Far distant stars are like your eyes
They're so pretty-y

Shined under the moonlight, uncovering the darkness
You just look so beautiful
So please smile, like right now
Don't cry, I don't want you to be sad

Shaded time, every lonely night
Don't endure it alone, just take my hand
I like the sound of laughter better than crying
Baby, I'll take you there

I'll take you anywhere
I'm coming with you, you
You, you, you
I'm running without any thoughts
I'll run with you, run with you, you
I'll be right by your side

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Evеn if I fall again
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, it's okay
You can put it down for a bit

Yeah
It's supposed to be a hard dеal for everyone
As if I'm being fussy
I looked at you and thought if I could just endure it
Throw it away, It's too much for me
Do you want to be happy at this moment?
Even if you are late, will you stop for a bit and rest?
I have to take responsibility for the reality and future life
I don't know, in times like this I escape to you

Shaded time every lonely night
Don't endure it alone, just take my hand
I like the sound of laughter better than crying
Baby, I'll take you there

I'll take you anywhere
I'm coming with you, you
You, you, you
I'm running without any thoughts
I'll run with you, run with you, you
I'll be right by your side

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Even if I fall again
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, it's okay
You can put it down for a bit

When everything feels like a mess
Always remember today, alright
I'll always be by your side

I'll take you anywhere
I'm coming with you, you
You, you, you
I'm running without any thoughts
I'll run with you, run with you, you
I'll be right by your side

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Even if I fall again
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, it's okay
You can put it down for a bit
