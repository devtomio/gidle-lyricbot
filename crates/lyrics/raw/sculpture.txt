I wanna be that artwork
Everyone calls me crazy
Already, you are my artist
Whatever

I’ll do well
I won’t cut my hair short ever again
I told you
That friend isn’t a bad one
But if you don’t like her
I won’t meet her
I don’t doubt you
When I hang around, it’s hard to contact you at night
You should be tired if you slept late yesterday
Would you like to rest today?
It’s fascinating, right? I’m actually quite kind

Look at this
I fit everything to what you say and do
As you will draw it

I want to be loved crazily
Even if I become your sculpture
Can endure that pain of being cut down
It’s okay, I’m your sculpture
Your sculpture
Your sculpture
Your sculpture

I know, I see
I’m quite weird
If there’ll be a party
I’ll smile while tightening my dress again

Yes, look
I fit everything to what you say and do
Being drawn

I want to be loved crazily
Even if I become your sculpture
Can endure that pain of being cut down
It’s okay, I’m your sculpture
Your sculpture
Your sculpture
Your sculpture

I’m happy
No, is this happiness?
Being loved by you
I should be really happy

Even if my body that was sculptured gets cracks
Yes, it will be easier to lose me rather than to lose you

I’m being loved crazily
Even if I know I’m your sculpture
Can endure that pain of being broken down
It’s okay, I’m your sculpture
Your sculpture
Your sculpture
Your sculpture
