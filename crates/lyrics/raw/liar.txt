I've been woken up in different places
I'm used to it like a habit
Take a look around at these plates, yeah
There's nothing that I want
Lies I didn't even mean to say
I'm losing myself, so bad
Like a doll without emotions
It's a forced smile

I don't think I've changed, ayy, ayy
I don't wanna do this no more

You keep calling me a liar (Ah)
I don't feel any desire (Ah)
We speed and drifting, don't need no tires (Ah)
So you can call me filthy liar

Yo
Yeah, say whatever you want, yeah, I'm a crazy tomboy
Again, passport, dyed my hair blonde like her
Again, I'm not satisfied
Be sure to tell your mom I wasn't satisfied either
Saying what you're good at, those manners
Take the front instead of talking behind my back
Of course, you wouldn't have the guts
Before treating your next lover like a child
Get your spelling right, "No", jeez

I don't care about whatever you say to me, ayy, ayy
I don't wanna do this no more

You keep calling me a liar (Ah)
I don't feel any desire (Ah)
We speed and drifting, don't need no tires (Ah)
So you can call me filthy liar

I am high-priced like a diamond shine
Why you think that I'm a piece of glass?
Break my heart, you can see the real me
Go to hell, baby, what's it to ya?
I am high-priced like a diamond shine
Why you think that I'm a piece of glass?
Break my heart, you can see the real me
Go to hell, baby, what's it to ya?
Call me a liar

You keep calling me a liar (Ah)
I don't feel any desire (Ah)
We speed and drifting, don't need no tires (Ah)
So you can call me filthy liar
