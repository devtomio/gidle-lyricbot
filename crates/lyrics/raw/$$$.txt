Knock knock, Soyeon is coming in
Spotlight on my head
I’m different from all those Gulliver’s
Who think they’re hotshots
Fools who are so typical but are so thick-skinned
Thanks to them, I’m gonna rise
Otaku bookworm identity, no one can imitate
Guys are interested, girls go blah blah blah
My role model is Einstein and his shining genius
A different color, even with millions of dollars
It’s not enough to buy my time, you can’t overlook me
I’m just different by birth
Baby, you and I are so different
If you want me, learn your manners
A typical love, given rules
I’m not your girlfriend
Baby, you and I are so different
If you want me, come to me and follow
I don’t have common dreams, I have special luck
I’m not your girlfriend
Oh yeah
Different, different, I’m different
Oh yeah
Different, different, I’m different
If you want me, if you, if you want me
If you, if you want me
Bring it to me, million dollars
If you want me, if you, if you want me
If you, if you want me
Bring it to me million dollars
Just saying whatever? No thanks
My heart isn’t fluttering at all, sorry
Guys like you overflow
Here and there
Wherever I go, in the end, they love me
I’m not bad, I’m just honest
What’s so bad about doing what I wanna do
Don’t judge me
Don’t treat me however you want
I’m not bad, I’m just honest
What’s so bad about doing what I wanna do
Don’t judge me
Don’t treat me however you want
Oh yeah
Different, different, I’m different
Oh yeah
Different, different, I’m different
If you want me, if you, if you want me
If you, if you want me
Bring it to me, million dollars
