Your deep stare, it takes me far away
Attractively, arcanely and mysteriously
Your racy voice steals my heart
So dizzy, maybe it’s a maze
I can’t find the way out, I hear the calling from deep inside
You hided in the darkness, attracting me
Making me sink to you, making me call you
When I look at your eyes, I forget everything but you

I’m in endless darkness, there is no exit
Where am I

Maybe I’m in your maze
Lost my way
I’m trapped in the maze inside you
Maybe I’m in your maze
Lost my way
I’m trapped in your own maze
Maybe I’m in your maze

Beautiful guitar sounds, it calls me from far away
It sinks into my ears, doo doo doo doo doo yeah
Your beckoning, it tickles my heart
Like the butterfly in my dream, maybe it’s a maze

I’m in maze, days in here
Never let me wonder about days outside
I’m trapped in the maze filled up with the darkness
No, maybe I trapped myself in here

I’m in endless darkness, there is no exit
Where am I

Maybe I’m in your maze
Lost my way
I’m trapped in the maze inside you
Maybe I’m in your maze
Lost my way
I’m trapped in your own maze
Maybe I’m in your maze

I wanna look pretty only to you
I wanna see you come to me
I’m yelling your name
In this maze, once again

Now you’re in my maze (My maze)
You’ trapped in the maze inside me
Now you’re in my maze (Oh yeah)
You’re trapped in my own maze
Now you’re in my maze
(In the maze inside me)

You’re trapped in my own maze
Now you’re in my maze
