Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Baby don’t you know
Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Can’t you help me now

You still don’t know
You really don’t know
I wanna be the only one
Who knows

Just looking at you
Makes me so happy
You can just
Smile like that

Every day, you're
Hiding inside of me, baby
Oh no, what do I do?
Oh, when you’re looking at me

Closely, I’ve never felt this way
Where do I start? What do I do?
I’m so nervous, I can’t do anything
Help me now, help me now

Feels like a dream, I’ve never felt this way
Where do I start? What do I do? I don’t know
In front of you, I can’t do anything
Help me now, help me now
Can’t you feel it now

Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Baby don’t you know
Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Can’t you help me now

Feels like my heart will explode
These awkward scenes, is it really love?
Cuz it’s the first time I’ve become a star
When I used to just be an extra

Can’t do anything
Like a newbie driver on the highway
Sometimes, I get nervous
But since I started, I wanna go to you

Every day, you're
Hiding inside of me, baby
Oh no, what do I do?
Oh, when you’re looking at me

Closely, I’ve never felt this way
Where do I start? What do I do?
I’m so nervous, I can’t do anything
Help me now, help me now
I can feel you now
 
Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Baby don’t you know
Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Can’t you help me now

This feels so awkward, I don’t like it
Whatever I say
It's not like me
This is love from reality
Can’t you feel it?

Closely, I’ve never felt this way
Where do I start? What do I do?
I’m so nervous, I can’t do anything
Help me now, help me now
I can feel you now

Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Baby don’t you know
Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
Feel you now

Oh uh woo uh
Uh woo uh uh
Oh uh woo uh
