I’m not fluttering
By a common invitation
Get ready baby (No no baby)
Before I’m taken by someone
Show me your true love
Mesmerized fashion (Show me passion)

So especially (especially)
You make me think (make me think)
Hey, to be honest with my feelings
I have noticed (I think about you)
Don’t wait, let’s start it quickly
My heart is beating fast (Coming over me)

Baby light my fire
Come closer, hurry up
I wanna get you, I won’t let you escape
I wanna get you, you’re mine
Baby light my fire
More heart heated up
I wanna, you can be forced
(I wanna feel your love)

So is it yes or no
Move on right now (Just let me know)
Only this time, let’s go
Oh fire

Don’t compare with anyone
Stop thinking
So you know I feeling no good (No no thank you)
Don’t roundabout
There is no reason
Forthright, tell me your heart (Tell me your heart)

Hey to be honest
If you want to do something
Do it right now (Can’t wait anymore)
(Do it right now Yeah)
I want you to be clear, do not keep me guessing
My heart is going pit-a-pat (I’m coming over you)

Baby light my fire
More heart burning up
I wanna get you my best
I wanna get you, I’m in love
Baby light my fire
I want to feel it more
I wanna monopolize you
(I wanna hold your love)

Love’s countdown, don’t stop
Move on right now (Just let me know)
Hug me now, let’s go
Oh fire
